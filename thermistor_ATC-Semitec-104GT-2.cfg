sensor_pin: PF7
#   Analog input pin connected to the thermistor. This parameter must
#   be provided.
#pullup_resistor: 4700
#   The resistance (in ohms) of the pullup attached to the thermistor.
#   The default is 4700 ohms.
#inline_resistor: 0
#   The resistance (in ohms) of an extra (not heat varying) resistor
#   that is placed inline with the thermistor. It is rare to set this.
